This report isn't a request for enforcement (which is why I am not labeling it ""illegal Parking""), is a request to fix the bike lane. As is, this bike lane is unusable because it is an open invitation to drivers to use it to pull over. This isn't a bike lane, it's a temporary parking lane, where anyone on a bicycle is expected to merge into fast (and impatient) traffic. I have been personally threatened by drivers (including an armored van driver!) for asking them not to park here. ""I'm just going to be a minute."" ""Why don't you just go around."" ""No one is going to ticket me here."" ""F*#k off, mind your own business."" Don't close this ticket and say ""area clear"". Fix this lane before another BU student is killed just trying to get around the Boston metro area. The longer you leave this, the more drivers will feel that they have every right to park here. I would like to be able to commute home without worrying whether I'll make it alive. Is avoiding flex posts here for plowing and delivery reasons worth my life?

I've lived near Olmsted Park in Jamaica Plain for many years now and often walk/bike along Willow Pond Road coming to and from the park. I've always wished there was a well-lit sidewalk and bike lane along each side of Willow Pond Road to make walking/biking safer, as many cars speed down that windy road. There is currently no sidewalk and no bike lanes. It's surprising there are no sidewalks, as many young kids use the park for baseball/softball games throughout the year. It's also surprising there are no bike lanes, as many bikers use this road to pass from the bike path along Pond Ave to the bike path along Jamaicaway (and vice versa). If this is not the right department to contact, please let me know who I should contact instead. Thanks for your consideration. Best, Dustin | Park owner: BPRD","Case Resolved.

creating a serious potentially deadly hazard for students and other commuters on bicycle or pedestrians on foot trying to cross a blocked crosswalk.

The solution is easy
Ticket them
Fine them
Threaten to revoke the Valets license

This stretch between Packard's Corner and the BU Bridge has been listed as one of the most dangerous areas for pedestrians in the state, yet I've never seen a BPD officer ticketing all these offenders. There's a new state law, $50 fine for parking in a bike lane illegally. Why does BPD never enforce this? They could be making hundreds of dollars an hour for the city if you assigned a cop to this stretch to hand out tickets. I'd much rather see these people endangering my life have to pay up, but I'd settle for a simple sign with the text ""$50 fine to park in bike lane, heavy enforcement area"" or something along those lines. It's downright negligent that these people get away with this every day of the week. There's only a little strip of road that's three feet wide, if they want to park illegally, how about they park in the right lane and make the cars merge into traffic instead of people who'll die if they get hit? Do something about this already, we can't wait until whenever you get around to building that cycle track...","Case Noted. Trans.

When I politely asked the driver if she knew she was parked in a dedicated bike lane, she replied - Um, okay, and then paused, and added - The City lets us park here. Calling her bluff, I asked - Really? and she said yeah.  Quick thinking, but an outright lie.

FedEx, please educate your drivers not to endanger the lives of cyclists.  Thank you.

The lane that was put there specifically because Mass Ave has been identified as a particularly treacherous route for cyclists and a cyclist was killed when a truck cut the corner and the back wheels crossed into the bike lane crushing her. Creating that bike lane with a painted buffer guides large vehicles around the bike lane when they make the turn. Having a truck parked in it defeats the purpose and endangers cyclists as they move into the traffic lane to avoid it. I stopped and spoke to the driver, who was polite, but his first reaction to the fact that I stopped to talk to him was to ask me if I was having a bad day. I had to explain to him why it was so important that he not park there. I think this point needs to be reiterated to city workers who, perhaps correctly so, believe they can park illegally as they do their work. They just really need to keep the bike lanes clear. It is about saving lives.","Case Noted. Spoke with employee and reiterated the bike lane regulations.  Driver was apologetic."
